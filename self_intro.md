- my name is sekhar reddy chandra. i have total 8 years of experience. I earlier worked as java developer
later i shifted to devops and cloud.

- i am now Devops Engineer in my project.
- we take care of all the deployments from DEV to prod through our automated process. we let develops only focus
  on programming we handle everything else.
- we are following devsecops, shiftleft, build once and run anywhere strategies. wee have our centralized cicd     
  pipelines powered by jenkins shared libraries

- we are following feature branching model, we have two types of branches. one is main as long lived branch and everything else is feature branches Earlier we followed git model where we had master and develop as long lived branches and  release, feature and hotfix as short lived branches.

- developers create features branches, once they push the code to remote branch we configured automated buildbranch pipelines through jenkins webhooks.

- once they complete development they raise PR and get the approval

- we are following shiftleft where we scan and test the application in early stages like development. so that we can filter majority issues while development is going on.

- we have sonarqube static source code analysis and static application security testing. we have quality gates configured where it checks for 0 issues, 0 bugs, 0 vulnarabilites, maintainability and security ratings
